# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds and had to complete the test suite using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development".

## Outcome

I was able to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.
